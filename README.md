# Overview
ScryTask is a minimal, lightweight, terminal-based TODO list for Linux.
It is focused on not overwhelming the user with complicated features or with a huge list of tasks.
A limited number of tasks is shown at once, and you can only choose to do it now, send it to the bottom of the list or set a correct start/due date.

It is also possible to limit the view into a subset of tasks, so you can view different lists for different contexts.


# Getting started

1. Install taskscry with `pip install scrytask`
2. Run scrytask with `scrytask`
3. Add tasks with `add (task description)`.
4. Show tasks in list mode with `list` or in tree mode with `tree`.
5. Complete a task with `done (task)`. Remove with `rm (task)`.
